JobRole â€” Job type (Engineer, HR, Manager, etc.).

The notebook has taken us through an exploratory analysis of employee burnout data. I created several visualizations covering data distributions and variable relationships. My model used a logistic regression approach to predict employee burnout, and the predictors performance was measured using accuracy and a confusion matrix.
